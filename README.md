#### _A simple interpreter for a simple language...Zap!_


This package is heavily based on the "Monkey" programming language and interpreter implementation, created by Thorsten Ball. 

#### It is NOT intended for production use!

The purpose of this interpreter is for me and others to learn as I work my way through the book [_"Writing an Interpreter in Go"_ ](https://interpreterbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball.  All of the credit for this interpreter goes to Thorsten Ball as he is the true creator and should be treated as such.  He contributed all knowledge, tutorials, walkthroughs, implementation details and comic relief throughout his book/tutorial.  Therefore, it should be absolutely clear that although this interpreter is or will be eventually functional and useful, it is not intended for production.

If anyone else views this package as I work through Thorsten's book, I hope it provides assistance and further understanding.  

If you or anyone has any questions for me regarding implementation choices that I made differently from "Writing an Interpreter in Go," or any questions about my journey whatsoever, please feel free to contact me.
