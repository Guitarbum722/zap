#### _A simple interpreter for a simple language...Zap!_


This interpreter is heavily based on the "Monkey" programming language, created by Thorsten Ball. 

#### It is NOT intended for production use!

The purpose of this interpreter is for me and others to learn as I work my way through the book [_"Writing an Interpreter in Go"_ ](https://interpreterbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball.
